In C++, **abstract classes** and **interfaces** are both mechanisms to define contracts that derived classes must follow.  
They rely on **pure virtual functions**, which declare a function signature without providing an implementation.

This example demonstrates:
- An **abstract class** (`Animal`) with a pure virtual function and a regular member function.
- An **interface-like** class (`Drawable`) containing only pure virtual functions.
- A **concrete class** (`Cat`) that inherits from **both**, illustrating multiple inheritance.

 * @details
 * This program defines:
 * - An abstract class `Animal` with a pure virtual function.
 * - An interface-like class `Drawable` with pure virtual functions.
 * - A concrete class `Cat` that inherits from both and implements all required functions.

## Interface in C++
C++ does not have a native interface keyword like Java or C#.
Instead, an interface can be represented as:
A class containing only pure virtual functions.
No data members (by convention).
Public inheritance from it signals "implements this contract."
```Cpp
class Drawable {
public:
    virtual void draw() = 0;
    virtual void setPosition(int x, int y) = 0;
};
```
## Multiple Inheritance
C++ allows a class to inherit from multiple base classes:
Useful for combining behaviors from multiple sources.
Potentially risky because of the diamond problem, which can be resolved with virtual inheritance when needed.
In our example, Cat inherits from both Animal and Drawable.
```Cpp
class Cat : public Animal, public Drawable {
    ...
};
```

## Best Practices
- Use abstract classes when you want partial implementation and shared state among derived classes.
- Use interfaces (pure virtual classes) when you only want to enforce a contract.
- In multiple inheritance, avoid ambiguous base class paths â€” consider virtual inheritance if needed.
- Clearly document which base class provides which responsibility.
