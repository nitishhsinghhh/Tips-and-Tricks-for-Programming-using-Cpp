# ASCII Chart

The following chart contains all 128 ASCII decimal (dec), octal (oct), hexadecimal (hex) and character (ch) codes.

## What the Chart Shows
The chart is organized into four columns per row, and each column contains:

### 1. Decimal (`dec`)
- **Base 10** number system (0â€“9)
- This is the standard numbering system used in everyday life.
- Example: `65` in decimal represents the character `'A'`.

### 2. Octal (`oct`)
- **Base 8** number system (0â€“7)
- Commonly used in older computing systems and Unix file permissions.
- Example: `101` in octal is equal to `65` in decimal, which is `'A'` in ASCII.

### 3. Hexadecimal (`hex`)
- **Base 16** number system (0â€“9 and Aâ€“F)
- Widely used in programming and debugging due to its compact binary representation.
- Example: `41` in hexadecimal is equal to `65` in decimal, which is `'A'` in ASCII.

Conversion Example

| Format      | Value | ASCII Character |
|-------------|-------|-----------------|
| Decimal     | 65    | `'A'`           |
| Octal       | 101   | `'A'`           |
| Hexadecimal | 41    | `'A'`           |

### ðŸ§  Why It Matters
Understanding these formats is essential for:
- Debugging memory and binary data
- Working with low-level system code
- Encoding and decoding data
- Interpreting ASCII tables and character sets

### ch: Character (symbol or control code)
Each row shows four such entries, so you can see all 128 ASCII codes from 0 to 127.

## Types of Characters in ASCII

###  Control Characters (0â€“31 and 127)
These are non-printable characters used for control in text streams:

- 0 (NUL): Null
- 7 (BEL): Bell (triggers a beep)
- 8 (BS): Backspace
- 9 (HT): Horizontal Tab
- 10 (LF): Line Feed (newline)
- 13 (CR): Carriage Return
- 27 (ESC): Escape
- 127 (DEL): Delete
These are useful in low-level programming, terminal control, and communication protocols.

### . Printable Characters (32â€“126)
These include:

- Space (32)
- Digits: 48â€“57 â†’ '0' to '9'
- Uppercase letters: 65â€“90 â†’ 'A' to 'Z'
- Lowercase letters: 97â€“122 â†’ 'a' to 'z'
- Symbols: 33â€“47, 58â€“64, 91â€“96, 123â€“126 â†’ like !, @, [, }, etc.

```CPP
// GCC 13.1: C++ 23
#include <iostream>
/**
 * @desc
 * This program prints all printable ASCII characters in the range [32..126].
 * It displays them in a formatted way, printing a newline after every 32 characters.
 *
 * @result
 * Outputs the printable ASCII characters from space (' ') to tilde ('~') to the console.
 */
int main() {
    std::cout << "Printable ASCII [32..126]:\n";

    // Loop through characters from ASCII 32 (' ') to 126 ('~')
    for (char c{ ' ' }; c <= '~'; ++c)
        // Print character followed by a space or newline every 32 characters
        std::cout << c << ((c + 1) % 32 ? ' ' : '\n');
    std::cout << '\n';
}
```
```
Output: 
Printable ASCII [32..126]:
  ! " # $ % & ' ( ) * + , - . / 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 : ; < = > ?
@ A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z [ \ ] ^ _
` a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z { | } ~
```
