## 📌 Overview

This project demonstrates a simple C++ application that performs addition of numeric character strings. It includes two versions:

1. **[Basic Version](./codeV1.0.cpp)**: Adds two hardcoded character digits.
2. **[Extended Version](../codeV1.1.cpp)**: Accepts user input, validates it, and performs addition.

## 🧩 Components

### 1. `InputValidator`  
Validates that the input string:
- Contains only numeric characters.
- Represents a number between **1 and 3998** (inclusive).

### 2. `CharAdder`  
Adds two numeric strings by:
- Converting each character to its integer value.
- Summing the resulting integers.

### 3. `UserInput`  
Handles user interaction by:
- Prompting the user for input.
- Returning the entered string.
