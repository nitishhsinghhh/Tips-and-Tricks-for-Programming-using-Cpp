# Validating Input Data in C++ Programming
ASCII, which stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange, is a character encoding standard used in computers and communication equipment to represent text and control characters. In the context of validating input, ASCII can be used to convert characters to their corresponding numeric values.

When a character is input by the user, it is represented in the computer's memory as a numeric value based on the ASCII encoding. For example, the character '0' has an ASCII value of 48, '1' has a value of 49, and so on up to '9' with a value of 57.

In the provided code snippet, the input character is converted to a numeric value by subtracting the ASCII value of '0' (48) from the input character's ASCII value. This conversion allows the program to work with numeric values directly and perform validation based on the input range from 1 to 9.

By leveraging ASCII values in this manner, the program can efficiently validate user input and ensure that it meets the specified criteria without explicitly checking each possible character input. This approach simplifies the validation process by relying on the inherent numeric representation of characters in the ASCII encoding scheme.
