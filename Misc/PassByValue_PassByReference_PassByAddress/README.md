# Understanding Function Argument Passing in C++
In C++, functions can receive arguments in three standard ways: by value, by reference, and by address. Each method has its own use cases and implications, which can affect performance and behavior, especially when dealing with large data structures like vectors. Let's explore these concepts using the smallest_element function as an example.

## The Problem with Pass by Value (aka Pass-By-Copy)
Consider the following function that finds the smallest element in a vector:
![value_machine](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c2424ba8-aad5-4d84-8ef6-778f32890f32)


```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <chrono>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using std::cout;
using std::endl;
using std::vector;

/**
 * @brief Finds the smallest element in a vector of integers.
 * @param vec The vector of integers to search.
 * @return The smallest integer in the vector.
 */
int smallest_element(vector<int> vec) {
    auto smallest_val = vec[0];
    for (int x : vec)
        smallest_val = std::min(smallest_val, x);
    return smallest_val;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> vec;
    for (int i = 0; i < 1000000; ++i)
        vec.push_back(rand());

    auto start = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
    int res = smallest_element(vec);
    auto end = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();

    std::chrono::duration<double> duration = end - start;

    cout << "Smallest element: " << res << endl;
    cout << "Time taken: " << duration.count() << " seconds" << endl;

    return 0;
}
```
Here, the vector vec is passed by value. This means a copy of the vector is made each time the function is called, which is inefficient for large vectors.

## Pass by Reference
To improve efficiency, we can pass the vector by reference. This allows the function to operate directly on the original vector without making a copy:
![reference_machine](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4262e8bf-9b22-484f-8a9a-a79374e9b72f)


```cpp
// GCC 13.1 C++23

#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm> 
#include <chrono> 

using std::cout;
using std::endl;
using std::vector;

/**
 * @brief Finds the smallest element in a vector of integers.
 * @param vec A constant reference to the vector of integers.
 * @return The smallest integer in the vector.
 */
int smallest_element(const vector<int>& vec) {
    auto smallest_val = vec[0];
    for (auto x : vec) 
        smallest_val = std::min(smallest_val, x);
    
    return smallest_val;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> vec;
    for (int i = 0; i < 1000000; ++i) 
        vec.push_back(rand());

    auto start = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
    int res = smallest_element(vec);
    auto end = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();

    std::chrono::duration<double> duration = end - start;
    
    cout << "Smallest element: " << res << endl;
    cout << "Time taken: " << duration.count() << " seconds" << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Important Note:
1. A reference is an alias for another variable, not a pointer or a copy.
2. References must be initialized when declared and cannot be null.

## Pass by Address  (aka Pass-By-pointer)
Alternatively, we can pass the vector by address using pointers. This method also allows the function to modify the original vector:
![pointer_machine](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/49ead60a-8299-452d-9ab4-eaec89b2b8d2)


```cpp
// GCC 13.1 C++23

#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm> 
#include <chrono>

using std::cout;
using std::endl;
using std::vector;

/**
 * @brief Finds the smallest element in a vector of integers using a pointer.
 * @param vec A pointer to the vector of integers.
 * @return The smallest integer in the vector.
 */
int smallest_element(vector<int>* vec) {
    auto smallest_val = (*vec)[0];
    for (auto x : *vec)
        smallest_val = std::min(smallest_val, x);
    return smallest_val;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> vec;
    for (int i = 0; i < 1000000; ++i) 
        vec.push_back(rand());

    auto start = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
    int res = smallest_element(&vec);
    auto end = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();

    std::chrono::duration<double> duration = end - start;
    
    cout << "Smallest element: " << res << endl;
    cout << "Time taken: " << duration.count() << " seconds" << endl;

    return 0;
}
```
### Key Points:
1. A pointer holds the memory address of a variable.
2. Pointers can be null, unlike references.
3. Using pointers provides better visibility for functions that modify the passed variables.

## Summary
1. Pass by Value: Copies the value of an argument. Safe but inefficient for large data structures.
2. Pass by Reference: Passes an alias to the original variable. Efficient and allows direct modification.
3. Pass by Address: Uses pointers to pass the memory address of variables. Provides visibility and control over modifications.
Understanding these methods and their implications helps in writing efficient and effective C++ code, especially when dealing with large data structures or performance-critical applications.

# Advanced concepts
The advanced techniques give developers more control over resource management, function behavior, and performance optimizations, but they require a deeper understanding of C++ and its features. They also introduce more complexity and, in some cases, can complicate debugging if not used carefully. Some of these are

- **Pass by Const Reference:** Pass objects by reference, but prevent modification.
- **Pass by R-Value Reference:** Move resources from temporary objects to avoid unnecessary copies.
- **Pass by Array:** Arrays decay to pointers when passed, and the size isn't known within the function.
- **Pass by Function Pointer:** Pass a pointer to a function to allow dynamic behavior or callbacks.
- **Pass by Lambda or Callable Object:** Pass a lambda or callable object for flexible, inline behavior.
