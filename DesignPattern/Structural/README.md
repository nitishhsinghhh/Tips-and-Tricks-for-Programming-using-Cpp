# Structural design patterns
Structural design patterns in software engineering focus on how classes and objects can be composed to form larger structures. These patterns simplify the design by identifying the relationships between classes and objects and addressing the composition of these elements to create cohesive and flexible structures.

Structural design patterns help in defining effective ways to build relationships between classes and objects, and they provide solutions to common design challenges related to class composition and object aggregation.

Key aspects addressed by structural design patterns include:

1. Class Inheritance: Providing guidelines for how classes inherit from each other, allowing for the creation of new classes based on existing ones while promoting code reuse and extensibility.
2. Object Composition: Defining mechanisms for how classes and objects are composed from other classes, enabling the creation of complex structures from simpler components.

By focusing on these aspects, structural design patterns offer a set of best practices and blueprints for creating well-organized and adaptable software structures.

Some common examples of structural design patterns include:

1. Adapter Pattern: Allows the interface of an existing class to be used as another interface, providing compatibility between incompatible interfaces.
2. Bridge Pattern: Decouples an abstraction from its implementation, allowing the two to vary independently.
3. Composite Pattern: Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies, allowing clients to treat individual objects and compositions uniformly.
4. Decorator Pattern: Attaches additional responsibilities to objects dynamically, providing a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.
5. Facade Pattern: Provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem, simplifying the usage of complex systems and hiding their complexities from clients.
6. Proxy Pattern: Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it, allowing for additional functionality to be provided when accessing the original object.

By leveraging these structural design patterns, software developers can create well-structured, modular, and maintainable systems, resulting in increased flexibility and adaptability to changing requirements.
