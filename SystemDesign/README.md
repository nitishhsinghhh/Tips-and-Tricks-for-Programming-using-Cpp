# Types of memory and storage 

# Memory Types
1. RAM (Random Access Memory)
- Volatile memory used for temporary data storage while programs are running.
- Faster than storage devices.
- Types: SRAM, DRAM, DDR4, DDR5
2. ROM (Read-Only Memory)
- Non-volatile memory that stores firmware.
- Data is permanent and not lost when power is off.
3. SRAM (Static RAM)
- Faster and more expensive than DRAM.
- Used in CPU caches.
- Doesnâ€™t need to be refreshed.
4. DRAM (Dynamic RAM)
- Slower and cheaper than SRAM.
- Needs constant refreshing.
- Used in main system memory (e.g., DDR4, DDR5).
5. DDR4 vs DDR5
  - DDR4: Widely used, up to 3200 MT/s.
  - DDR5: Higher bandwidth and efficiency, up to 8400 MT/s and beyond.
