# Tips and Tricks for Programming using Cpp

Welcome to the GitHub repository! Here, you'll find all the code and resources from my [**Medium**](https://nitishhsinghhh.medium.com/) articles, focused on sharing practical tips for C++ developers. My aim is to provide easy-to-understand solutions and useful advice to help developers improve their C++ skills.

The articles cover a wide range of **C++ programming** topics, from basic concepts to more advanced techniques. Whether you're just starting out or have years of experience, you'll find helpful tips and examples to boost your knowledge and make coding easier.

No matter your skill level, this repository is a great place to learn and grow. Let‚Äôs work together to build a stronger, more knowledgeable tech community!

## How to Use

To run these programs, you need to have a C++ compiler installed on your computer. Once that's set up, you can download the program files from this repository and compile them using the compiler. Since C++ is a compiled language, the code needs to be converted from a human-readable format into something a computer can understand. This conversion is done by a tool called a compiler.

Typically C++ source code files are given the suffix:
1. .cpp (ex: firstCode.cpp) or
2. .h (ex: std_lib_facilities.h).

- Compile:
g++ firstCode.cpp -o firstCode <br>
A compiler translates the C++ program into machine language code which it stores on the disk as a file with the extension .o (e.g. firstCode.o). A linker then links the object code with standard library routines that the program may use and creates an executable image which is also saved on disk, usually as a file with the file name without any extension (e.g. firstCode).

- Execute:
./firstCode <br>
The executable is loaded from the disk to memory and the computer‚Äôs CPU (Central Processing Unit) executes the program one instruction at a time.
Alternatively, you can also use an online C++ compiler to run these programs without needing to install a compiler on your computer.

## Getting Started
To compile and run these programs on your local machine, you'll need to have the appropriate programming language and compiler installed. Here are the steps to get started:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using git clone.
2. Navigate to the folder containing the program you want to run.
3. Follow the instructions in the program's README file to compile and run the program.

## Code Documentation Style: Doxygen
This repository follows **[Doxygen-style comments](https://www.doxygen.nl/manual/docblocks.html)** to document all major classes, functions, and modules. Doxygen is a powerful tool that generates structured documentation from annotated C++ source code, making it easier for developers to understand and contribute to the project.
