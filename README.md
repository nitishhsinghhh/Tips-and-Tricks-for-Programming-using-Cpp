# Tips and Tricks for Programming using Cpp

Welcome to the GitHub repository! Here, you'll find all the code and resources from my [**Medium**](https://nitishhsinghhh.medium.com/) articles, focused on sharing practical tips for C++ developers. My aim is to provide easy-to-understand solutions and useful advice to help developers improve their C++ skills.

The articles cover a wide range of **C++ programming** topics, from basic concepts to more advanced techniques. Whether you're just starting out or have years of experience, you'll find helpful tips and examples to boost your knowledge and make coding easier.

No matter your skill level, this repository is a great place to learn and grow. Let’s work together to build a stronger, more knowledgeable tech community!

## How to use it

Everything below is an outline, and you should tackle the items in order from top to bottom.

I'm using GitHub's special markdown flavor, including tasks lists to track progress.
  - [More about GitHub-flavored markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/#GitHub-flavored-markdown)

### If you don't want to use git

On this page, click the Code button near the top, then click "Download ZIP". Unzip the file and you can work with the text files.

If you're open in a code editor that understands markdown, you'll see everything formatted nicely.

### If you're comfortable with git

Create a new branch so you can check items like this, just put an x in the brackets: [x]

1. ***Fork the GitHub repo:*** `https://github.com/nitishhsinghhh/Tips-and-Tricks-for-Programming-using-Cpp` by clicking on the Fork button.

    ![Fork the GitHub repo](https://d3j2pkmjtin6ou.cloudfront.net/fork-button.png)

1. Clone to your local repo:

    ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>/Tips-and-Tricks-for-Programming-using-Cpp.git
      cd Tips-and-Tricks-for-Programming-using-Cpp

      git remote add upstream https://github.com/nitishhsinghhh/Tips-and-Tricks-for-Programming-using-Cpp.git
      git remote set-url --push upstream DISABLE  # prevent accidental pushes to original repo
    ```

1. Mark all boxes with X after you completed your changes:

    ```bash
      git commit -am "Marked personal progress"
      git pull upstream main   # keep your fork up-to-date with the original repository
      git push                # pushes changes to your fork
    ```

## What You’ll Find Here
- Hands-on C++ examples from beginner to advanced.
- STL internals & custom implementations:
  - Stack using Queue
  - Custom Vector Class
- Problem-solving patterns for interviews.
- Computer Science basics explained with code.
- Project ideas for practice.

## Why This Repo?
C++ is a powerful language, but mastering its nuances takes time. This repo bridges the gap between theory and practice by providing:

- Clear, documented code (Doxygen-style).
- Real-world examples for interviews and system design.
- Performance insights for writing optimized solutions.

## How to Use

To run these programs, you need to have a C++ compiler installed on your computer. Once that's set up, you can download the program files from this repository and compile them using the compiler. Since C++ is a compiled language, the code needs to be converted from a human-readable format into something a computer can understand. This conversion is done by a tool called a compiler.

Typically C++ source code files are given the suffix:
1. .cpp (ex: firstCode.cpp) or
2. .h (ex: std_lib_facilities.h).

- Compile:
g++ firstCode.cpp -o firstCode <br>
A compiler translates the C++ program into machine language code which it stores on the disk as a file with the extension .o (e.g. firstCode.o). A linker then links the object code with standard library routines that the program may use and creates an executable image which is also saved on disk, usually as a file with the file name without any extension (e.g. firstCode).

- Execute:
./firstCode <br>
The executable is loaded from the disk to memory and the computer’s CPU (Central Processing Unit) executes the program one instruction at a time.
Alternatively, you can also use an online C++ compiler to run these programs without needing to install a compiler on your computer.
